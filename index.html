      <span class="v72_65">
        “Our children are our greatest treasure… Those who abuse them tear at the fabric of our society and weaken our
        nation.” Nelson Mandela’s words remind us that child abuse is more than just a personal tragedy—it’s a quiet
        force that can destroy entire communities. Under SDG 16—Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions—ending child
        abuse is a global priority. Think of society as a living body, and children as its vital cells. When those cells
        are damaged, the whole system starts to fail. And if the harm spreads—if hurt children grow up carrying pain,
        anger, and fear—we risk a future built on broken foundations.
        <br /><br />
      <span class="call_action">
        That’s why we must act now: speak up, protect children early, and create a world where they are safe to grow,
        dream, and lead. The cost of silence is far too high.
